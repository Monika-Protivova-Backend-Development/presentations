				<h3>Deployment</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Deployment is the process of making an application available for use on a specific environment.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Deployment can include various tasks such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Building an application package (jar, Docker image, binary).
						</li>
						<li>
							Configuring the target environment.
						</li>
						<li>

				<h3>Environments</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Environments are used at distinct stages in the software development lifecycle,
					each serving a specific purpose.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Each environment has its own configuration, data, and access controls to ensure that changes
						can be tested safely before going live.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							However, it is beneficial to keep the environments as similar to production as possible
							to avoid issues when deploying to production.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>Typical environments include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Local</li>
						<li>Development / Integration</li>
						<li>Staging</li>
						<li>Production</li>

				<h3>Environments</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Environments are used at distinct stages in the software development lifecycle.
				</div>
				<div class="content" style="font-size: 70%">
					<h4>Local</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Usually the developer's machine, where they can run and test the application locally.</li>
						<li>Often uses containerization tools like Docker to ensure consistency across different developer machines.</li>
						<li>If running everything locally is not possible, and developers may use dedicated cloud resources for development.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h4>Development</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>A shared environment where developers can deploy their changes for testing and integration.</li>
						<li>It is often used for collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase.</li>
						<li>May include automated tests to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h4>Staging</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>A pre-production environment that closely mirrors the production environment.</li>
						<li>It is used for final testing and validation of the application before it goes live.</li>
						<li>Staging environments often use production-like data and configurations to ensure that the application behaves as expected in production.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h4>Production</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The live environment where the application is accessible to end users.</li>
						<li>It is critical to ensure that the application is stable, secure, and performs well in this environment.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware and software components that support the deployment and operation of applications.
					<!--					Physical machines, virtual machines, and containers are the three main types of environments used for deployment.-->
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Infrastructure can be categorized into different types based on how applications are deployed and run.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong class="highlight">Physical machines</strong> are dedicated hardware servers that run the application directly on the operating system.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong class="highlight">Virtual machines (VMs)</strong> are software emulations of physical machines that run on a hypervisor,
							allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical server.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong class="highlight">Containers</strong> are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies together.
							They run on a shared operating system kernel, making them more efficient than VMs.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						You can also distinguish between <strong class="highlight">self-managed infrastructure</strong> and <strong class="highlight">managed services</strong>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong class="highlight">Self-managed infrastructure</strong> requires you to set up and maintain the servers, networking, and storage.</li>
						<li><strong class="highlight">Managed services</strong> provide a fully managed environment where the provider takes care of the infrastructure.</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>
						Different strategies come with a different cost and maintenance overhead.

				<h3>Platform as Service (PaaS)</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					<strong>PaaS</strong> delivers a platform that allows developers to build, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure management.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						It includes the operating system, programming language runtime, databases, and web servers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Key Features:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users manage: applications and data.</li>
						<li>Provider manages: runtime, OS, infrastructure.</li>
						<li>Speeds up development and deployment with built-in tools and integrations.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>Examples:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services.</p>
				</div>

			<section>
				<h3>Infrastructure as Service</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>It delivers fundamental IT infrastructure‚Äîlike virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems‚Äîon a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Key Features:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users manage: OS, applications, runtime, and data.</li>
						<li>Provider manages: physical hardware, networking, virtualization.</li>
						<li>Offers flexibility and control over infrastructure.</li>

				<h3>Infrastructure as Code</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						It utilizes machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Key Features:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Infrastructure is version-controlled, testable, and reproducible.</li>
						<li>Reduces human error and enables automation and consistency.</li>
						<li>Often used with tools like Terraform, Ansible, or AWS CloudFormation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>Example Use:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Defining and deploying cloud infrastructure (like networks, VMs, and services) with code, rather than clicking through a UI or configuring everything manually on servers.

				<h2>Deployment Strategies</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Blue-Green Deployment</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					The Blue-Green strategy involves maintaining two identical production environments,
					referred to as "blue" and "green".
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						The goal of this strategy is to reduce downtime and risk by running two identical production environments.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>One environment (blue) is live production,</li>
						<li>while the other (green) is idle or used for staging.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						When a new version of the application is ready, it is deployed to the idle environment (green).
					</p>
					<p>
						After testing and validation, traffic is switched from the live environment (blue) to the new environment (green).
					</p>
					<p>
						This allows for quick rollback if issues arise, as the previous version is still running in the blue environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						It also allows for (near) zero-downtime deployments, as the switch can be done instantly without affecting users.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Canary Releases</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Canary releases involve deploying a new version of an application to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						This approach allows you to test new features or changes in production with reduced risk.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A small portion of traffic is routed to the new version (the "canary").</li>
						<li>The rest of the traffic continues to use the stable version.</li>
						<li>If metrics and error rates are acceptable, the new version is gradually rolled out to more users.</li>
						<li>If issues are detected, the canary can be rolled back quickly without impacting most users.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Used in:</b> systems with real user traffic analysis, automated monitoring and rollback capabilities.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Rolling Updates</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Rolling updates involve gradually updating instances of an application in a production environment.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Instead of stopping and replacing all instances at once, rolling updates upgrade one or a few instances at a time.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Minimizes downtime and avoids a full system restart.</li>
						<li>Each instance is updated and verified before moving to the next.</li>
						<li>Common in container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), which handle update strategies automatically.</li>
						<li>Risk is distributed over time; partial rollback may be possible if issues are detected.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Trade-off:</b> More complex monitoring needed to detect errors mid-rollout.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Feature Toggles</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Feature toggles (or feature flags) are a technique that allows developers to enable or disable features in an application without deploying new code.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Features can be turned on/off at runtime via configuration, targeting specific users or segments.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Enables safe testing of features in production (with limited exposure).</li>
						<li>Facilitates A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts.</li>
						<li>Allows quick disabling of problematic features without rollback.</li>
						<li>Useful for separating deploy from release (deployment happens first, feature is turned on later).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Tools:</b> LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Flipt, or custom flag systems.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						"Deploy != Release" ‚Äî feature toggles help decouple the two.

				<h3>Deployment Tools</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Deployment tools help automate the process of delivering applications to various environments.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						They allow consistent, repeatable, and automated deployment workflows, reducing human error and enabling rapid iteration.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Common Categories:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Scripted Deployments:</strong> Bash, Gradle, or Kotlin scripts for custom tasks.</li>
						<li><strong>Container Orchestration:</strong> Kubernetes, Docker Compose.</li>
						<li><strong>CI/CD Systems:</strong> GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI.</li>

				<h3>CI / CD</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery or Deployment.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>CI (Continuous Integration)</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Automatically integrates code changes into a shared repository several times a day.</li>
						<li>Each change triggers a build and a suite of automated tests.</li>
						<li>Ensures code quality, catches bugs early, and supports team collaboration.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Continuous Delivery:</em> Automatically prepares every change for release but requires manual approval to deploy to production.</li>
						<li><em>Continuous Deployment:</em> Automatically releases every passing change to production without manual intervention.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						CI/CD encourages small, incremental, and reliable updates, leading to faster feedback and lower risk.

				<h3>CI/CD Pipelines</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					CI/CD pipelines define a series of steps to build, test, and deploy software in an automated fashion.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>Typical stages of a CI/CD pipeline:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Source:</strong> Code is pushed to the version control system (e.g., GitHub).</li>
						<li><strong>Build:</strong> Application is compiled and packaged (e.g., Kotlin app ‚Üí JAR or Docker image).</li>
						<li><strong>Test:</strong> Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are executed.</li>
						<li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Code is deployed to dev/staging/production environments.</li>
						<li><strong>Notify:</strong> Developers are informed of failures/success via email, Slack, etc.</li>

				<h3>Configuration and Secrets</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Managing configuration and secrets is one of the 12-Factor App principles.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						The configuration may contain settings that can change between different environments,
						but also sensitive information and application secrets.
					</p>
					<p>Environment specific configuration:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Application port</li>
						<li>Database connection strings</li>
						<li>Application specific settings</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Application secrets:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Database credentials</li>
						<li>API keys for third-party services</li>
						<li>JWT secrets for signing tokens</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>
						Any sensitive information should not be hard-coded in the application code or shipped with the application.
					</blockquote>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Managing Configurations</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Application configuration should be externalized and environment-specific.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Configurations include settings like database URLs, API endpoints, log levels, and feature toggles.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not hardcode configurations in code.</li>
						<li>Use environment variables, config files, or config servers.</li>
						<li>Use profiles (e.g., dev, staging, prod) to switch configurations easily.</li>
						<li>Track configuration versions for auditability and rollback.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Spring Cloud Config, Consul, Kubernetes ConfigMaps, dotenv libraries.</p>
				</div>

			<section>
				<h3>Managing Secrets</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Secrets like passwords, tokens, and API keys must be stored securely and never hardcoded.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>Common Secrets:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Database passwords</li>
						<li>Third-party API keys</li>
						<li>Encryption keys, JWT signing secrets</li>

					<p><strong>Secure Practices:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use secret management tools instead of config files.</li>
						<li>Set secrets through environment variables or secret volumes.</li>
						<li>Rotate secrets periodically and avoid printing them in logs.</li>

				<h3>Ktor Configuration Example</h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						When you build your application, it usually contains <strong class="highlight">non-sensitive</strong> configuration defaults in
						<code class="inline">src/main/resources/application.yaml</code> or <code class="inline">src/main/resources/application.conf</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will want to override some of these defaults in different environments.
						You have few options to do this:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong class="highlight">Pass configuration properties as command line arguments.</strong><br />
							<pre>
								<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs language-shell">
									./gradlew run --args='-Dktor.deployment.port=8080'
								</code>
							</pre>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong class="highlight">Use environment variables to override specific properties.</strong><br />
							<pre>
								<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs language-shell">
									export KTOR_DEPLOYMENT_PORT=8080

				<h3>Observability</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Observability is the ability to understand what's happening inside your system from the outside.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						It enables engineers to ask new questions about their system‚Äôs behavior without deploying new code.

				<h3>Health Checks & Monitoring</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Health checks and monitoring help you detect and respond to problems in production.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>Health Checks:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Liveness check:</strong> Is the app still running?</li>
						<li><strong>Readiness check:</strong> Can the app handle traffic?</li>
						<li>Common in Kubernetes and other orchestrators to manage service lifecycles.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Monitoring:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Continuously collects data on application health and performance.</li>
						<li>Monitors SLIs (e.g. latency, error rate, uptime) and triggers alerts if thresholds are crossed.</li>
						<li>Helps operators respond quickly to failures or degradation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Alerting Tools:</strong> Prometheus + Alertmanager, Datadog, Sentry, Grafana, PagerDuty.</p>

				<h3>Release</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Deployment vs. Release: Deployment is about making code available; release is about making features available.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						<strong>Deployment:</strong> The process of getting code into an environment (e.g. staging, production).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Release:</strong> The moment when a feature becomes visible or usable to users.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Feature may be deployed but disabled via feature toggle.</li>
						<li>Release can be a business decision ‚Äî decoupled from technical delivery.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This separation allows for safer deployments, better testing in production, and flexibility in rollout strategies.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						You can deploy often and release cautiously.

				<h3>Production-First Mindset</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					Designing with production in mind leads to more resilient and maintainable systems.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Instead of treating production as an afterthought, a production-first approach builds with real-world usage in mind.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plan for observability, deployment, scalability, and failure handling from the start.</li>
						<li>Use production-like environments during development.</li>
						<li>Automate everything: testing, builds, deployments, monitoring.</li>
						<li>Prioritize user impact, uptime, and recovery strategies.</li>
						<li>Include operational concerns (logging, alerting, maintenance) early in the development process.</li>
